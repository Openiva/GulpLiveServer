# AllinOne Gulp Live Server
This is a full Gulp live server, Sass processor and css minifier in one.
 
The Folder structure are auto-generated upon download from npm.

####2.1.0 acts as the full release for the now deprecated alpha:
[gulp-allinone-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-allinone-server "gulp-allinone-server")

# Usage
### Install using 
* 'npm init'
* `npx allinone-gulp-server`
 
##### Run this command in terminal to use the server:
* npm start 

(make sure your index.html is being exported to the dist folder)

To import/access them in another file:

```javascript
var gulpLiveServer = require("gulp-allinone-server");
 
```

And then you can call each function by calling:

```
myFunction.processHtml
myFunction.processSass
myFunction.watch
myFunction.server
```


```
Potentials in the future:
Babel support
User Requests
```
